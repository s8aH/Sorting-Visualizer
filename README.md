# Sorting-Visualizer

This program visualizes how sorting algorithms (Merge, Quick, Selection, Insertion, Bubble, and Heap) would sort a bar graph or .ppm image pixels using the Swing animation tool. The program comes with interactive functionalities, letting the user control the speed of the sorting processing, select one of two visualizations, and select an image from the options given or import their own image.

## Demo
Below is an animation of a sample run to visualize Merge Sort:
